    "Climate change is a very critical and ever-looming issue which many of us remain powerless over and can do nothing about but watch. It is because of this existential threatening nature, that makes it a very rewarding and reasonable data set to be interested in and analyze. We hope our findings from our results can give us some insight into what geographical and societal problem properties of countries may be in any way correlated to climate change and prove the threat this issue poses by showing what the future may look like if nothing is done about it. More specifically, with this data, we plan to derive how climate fluctuates from period to period depending on the geographical location and how much the climate has changed as the global population and pollution has increased. Some other datasets we were interested in were Chess games datasets, popular music datasets, and solar power generation datasets however this temperature change dataset stuck out to us for previously mentioned reasons.\n",
