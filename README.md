# Climate Change Is Inevitable But Do Some Countries Stand A Better Chance Against It Than Others?
## Introduction:
>&emsp; Climate change is a very critical and ever-looming issue which many of us remain powerless over and can do nothing about but watch. It is because of this threatening existential nature that makes it a very rewarding and reasonable data set to be interested in and analyze. We hope our findings can give us some insight into what geographical and societal problems of countries may be in any way correlated to climate change. Furthermore, our analysis can further prove the threat this issue poses by showing what the future may look like if nothing is done about it.\

&emsp;This project was worked on by Adam Callanan, Trevor Lee, and Angus Murchison. Adam found the dataset used, wrote the intro, came up with the questions explored, and solved a few questions. Trevor did the initial analysis of the data and solved the majority of the questions. Angus wrote the description for the dataset, the potential for data science, and conclusion.

&emsp; The FAOSTAT Temperature Change data set is a collection of the average change of temperature of 190 countries and 37 territories in Celsius,  recorded monthly from 1961-2019, giving the annual, seasonal and monthly temperature outliers with respect to the 1951-1980 recordings.
